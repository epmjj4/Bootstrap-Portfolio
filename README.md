![alt text](assets\images\contact-screenshot.png "Contact")

For the contact.html, in the nav bar, I changed the background color to bg-info and container to container-fluid. Under the links,  I added a link for my LinkedIn account and the other 2 links are mapped to the other files created in this project. When the webpage was collapsed, the hamburger icon didn't open and I had to update the data-target under the button and I added the id expandme to navbar-nav. I also created the header which contained h1 contact, and set the bootstrap text to display-3 and added the id contact. I added text-purple class to h1 & h5 elements so I can target via media query in css. For the footer, I added the container class, the background color was set to info, the text was set to light, and the margin-top is set to 5. I also added the footer tag with the copyright image, and gave btTag id to the a tag.

For the contact.css I adjusted the background color for the body and added the contact id. I adjusted the margin bottom for the button, form, and nav elements. I set the h1 element to text-align center. I set the background-color for the id contact to off white. I created 2 media queries to change color from blue to violet at the 992px breakpoint and from violet to red at the 700px breakpoint. I had to use the !important classification to override Bootstrap CSS. I also added the footer tag with the copyright image. Targeting the btTag, I added a hover class in yellow and changed text from blue to white so it could be seen better on the page.
