# contact-html-screenshot

![](assets\images\contact-screenshot.png)

For the contact.html, in the nav bar, I changed background to bg-info and container to container-fluid. 
When the webpage was collapsed, the hamburger icon didn't open and I had to update the data-target under button and I added id expandme to navbar-nav. I also created the contact h1, and set the bootstrap text to display-3 and added id contact. I added text-purple class to h1 & h5 elements so I can target via media query. 

For the contact.css I adjusted the background color for the body and the contact id. I adjusted the margin bottom for the button, form, and nav elements. Set the h1 to text-align center. I set background-color for the id contact to off white. I created 2 media queries to change color from blue to violet at 992px breakpoint and from violet to read at 700px, I had to use the !important classification to override Bootstrap CSS.
